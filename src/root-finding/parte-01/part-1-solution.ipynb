This would result in how close can the end point be while being reachable, which results in the constraint that appears above. When trying this with $3$ links, however, the process isn't that simple. Trying to put all links on the same line (making their respective angles either $180¬∞$ or $360¬∞$ degrees) won't always give the closest distance; angling the links _just right_ might probably get closer, or even exactly to, the zero point. \n",

To view it geometrically, take the same construction from before (the first link in one direction, and the others in the opposite one) and, if it surpasses the origin, try moving one of the link's end points (not the last link) to the side. This will change the starting point of the next link, but the other end point of that link should still be in the line proposed by the direction of the first link. By doing this movement, notice how the final end point of the arm is closer to the origin. This process is repeatable until the base is reached. \n",
