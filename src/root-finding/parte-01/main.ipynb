    "# **Newton's method: Systems of equations**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us consider Newton's method to find roots of some function $f(x)$ in an interval given by $[a,b]$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "x_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that in order to apply this method, we need that $f \\in \\mathcal{C}^2[a,b]$, as well as the existence of some $p \\in [a,b]$ such that $f(p) =0$ and $f'(p) \\neq 0$. These conditions guarantee the existence of some $\\delta > 0$ such that Newton's method converges to $p$ for any initial approximation $p_0 \\in [p-\\delta,p+\\delta]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a very nice method to solve for the roots of a function, as long as we pick a proper initial approximation. However, it would be nice to generalize this problem to not only solve for a single variable from a single equation, but rather an entire system of equations with $n$ variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this, let us write Newton's method in a different manner\n",

    "\n",
    "The reason why we are writing the iteration formula this way is to identify how can we create a vector version for the method. If we want to talk about a system of equations, then it's natural to think we will have variables $x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n$ and a total of $n$ equations, which can be represented as follows\n",
    "\n",

    "Then we can set this as a vector problem of the form $\\boldsymbol{F}(\\boldsymbol{X}) = \\boldsymbol{0}$, where $\\boldsymbol{F}(\\boldsymbol{X}) = (f_1, f_2, \\dots, f_n)^T$ and $\\boldsymbol{X} = (x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n)^T$ and the vector method we must build should have the form\n",

    "Where $\\Phi$ must represent something related to the derivative of $\\boldsymbol{F}$. For this let's start by something simpler.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$, then its derivative is another function of the form $f': \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$. This makes sense since $f$ only depends on one real argument, then it has a rate of change with respect to that single variable and nothing else.\n",
    "\n",
    "However if $f: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}$ it means that $f$ depends on n arguments, then it has $n$ rates of changes and we typically count them by taking partial derivatives given by $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_i}$. All of these derivatives can be gathered into what is known as the *gradient* of $f$, denoted by $\\nabla f$ and defined as follows\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's think about something more complex. Consider a function $\\boldsymbol{F}: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^m$. This is a vector field that contains $n$ components, and each component is a scalar function of $m$ variables. For each component $f_i(x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_m)$ we already know their derivatives are gradient vectors, which we may denote as $\\nabla f_i$, but this in general is the partial derivative of the component $f_i$ with respect to a variable $x_j$ (the indices may not be necessarily the same). This suggest that the \"total\" derivate for a vector field of this must keep track of two indices, since one is not enough to capture the behavior for all rates of change, so at the end we will have a matrix instead of a vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a vector field $\\boldsymbol{F}: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^m$, the derivate of $F$ is given by the *Jacobian* matrix $\\boldsymbol{J}: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}$, defined as\n",

    "The Jacobian matrix is precisely what we are looking for, since initially we have a vector field of the form $\\boldsymbol{F}: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$, then $\\boldsymbol{J}: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$. This makes a lot of sense since originally the problem is \n",

    "and since we are talking about $\\mathbb{R}^n$, the only object we can multiply a vector with (to get another vector) is a matrix. Scalarwise we had $f'(x_n)^{-1}$ so this suggest that vectorwise we use the inverse Jacobian matrix evaluated at $\\boldsymbol{X} = \\boldsymbol{X^{(k)}}$ and with this, we can defined the Newton's method for systems of equations as follows\n",
