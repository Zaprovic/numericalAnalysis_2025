    "# **Newton's method: Systems of equations**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us consider Newton's method to find roots of some function $f(x)$ in an interval given by $[a,b]$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "x_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that in order to apply this method, we need that $f \\in \\mathcal{C}^2[a,b]$, as well as the existence of some $p \\in [a,b]$ such that $f(p) =0$ and $f'(p) \\neq 0$. These conditions guarantee the existence of some $\\delta > 0$ such that Newton's method converges to $p$ for any initial approximation $p_0 \\in [p-\\delta,p+\\delta]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a very nice method to solve for the roots of a function, as long as we pick a proper initial approximation. However, it would be nice to generalize this problem to not only solve for a single variable from a single equation, but rather an entire system of equations with $n$ variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this, let us write Newton's method in a different manner\n",

    "x_{n+1} = x_n - f'(x_n)^{-1} \\cdot f(x_n)\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why we are writing the iteration formula this way is to identify how can we create a vector version for the method. If we want to talk about a system of equations, then it's natural to think we will have variables $x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n$ and a total of $n$ equations, which can be represented as follows\n",

    "Then we can set this as a vector problem of the form $\\boldsymbol{F}(\\boldsymbol{X}) = \\boldsymbol{0}$, where $\\boldsymbol{F}(\\boldsymbol{X}) = (f_1, f_2, \\dots, f_n)^T$ and $\\boldsymbol{X} = (x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n)^T$ and the vector method we must build should have the form\n",

    "$$\n",

    "Where $\\Phi$ must represent something related to the derivative of $\\boldsymbol{F}$. For this let's start by something simpler.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$, then its derivative is another function of the form $f': \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$. This makes sense since $f$ only depends on one real argument, then it has a rate of change with respect to that single variable and nothing else.\n",
    "\n",
    "However if $f: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}$ it means that $f$ depends on n arguments, then it has $n$ rates of changes and we typically count them by taking partial derivatives given by $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_i}$. All of these derivatives can be gathered into what is known as the *gradient* of $f$, denoted by $\\nabla f$ and defined as follows\n",
